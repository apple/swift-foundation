# Foundation Essentials

Access core types and essential functionality used by most applications.

## Overview

The FoundationEssentials package provides the most important types for everyday development:

* Core types beyond those provided by the Swift standard library: ``Data``, ``Decimal``, and ``UUID``.
* Dates and time intervals.
* A measurement API that supports various unit systems.
* File system access, preferences, archives, and serialization.
* A ``URL`` type and the _URL Loading System_ for accessing data indicated by URLs, including file reading and writing and data upload and download.

Foundation Essentials provides these features without system dependencies, so developers can count on consistent behavior, regardless of platform.
